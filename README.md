## Instructions 
To back up all files and/or folders in a working directory:
1. Place the `fbu.pyw` file in the directory, and open it. 
2. Select up to 3 backup destinations
3. Press "Backup Files or Backup Folders" to initiate the backup
  - If you wish for the program to remember which destinations you chose and re-use them by default, click on "Save Destinations". This will create a .JSON file named 'directorypull.JSON' which stores the selected destination directories for later use. 
  - It will also create a log file (toggleable in the GUI) inside of a folder in the working directory called "backup_logs" (on by default, and will create the folder upon opening the program)
